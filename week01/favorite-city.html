    <h1>My favorite City</h1>
    <p>I am looky living in my favorite city: Queretaro. Is located in the north-center of Mexico and 3 hours away from
        Mexico City.</p>
    <p>What I love the most is that Queretaro is still being a peace and calm city where a family can be reached. </p>
    <p>It has all a city can offer and also evething you can find in a little town.</p>
